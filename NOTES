if gnome is showing the homedir as the Desktop, the desktop is flickering and changing any file in the homedir
goes accompanied by a terrible slowdown, this may be due to either:
- ~/Desktop being missing or
- ~/.config/user-dirs.dirs listing XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/" instead of XDG_DESKTOP_DIR="$HOME/Desktop"
